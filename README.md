ABOUT THE PROJECT 
This website aims at helping farmers, to know about their soil type, fertilizers and possible crops and which are the crops suitable for cultivation in that land through their soil test results. It also gives the information about common pest attacking the crops, fertilizers and different irrigation methods needed for the crops are provided by this website. This provides a platform to farmers to know the different loan, schemes and seminars conducted by the government. 
The main features of the Agro Culture are as follows: 
1. Analyse the existing farming systems and identify its constraints & problems.
2. Design a new or improved farming system.
3. Identify conditions for successful implementation of the system.

5. User deals with taking appointment for seminars and soil testing directly to the lab and to the officer.

# PROPOSED SYSTEM  
The existing farming information sites are not dealing with the soil texting or not about any agricultural offices. The farmers of now days are even knowing about the government 
announcement through telephone and thaluk offices so this will be much more better if we could bring all these under a single roof. We propose such a project proposal with an aim that whenever this comes to real world Agro Culture is definitely going to meet the needs of common man in farming field to some extent. In our system, there are user to assign lands to other user for cultivation of crops.
